After invoking dine\r\nand before invoking leave a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe synchronization constraint that applies to students is that, in order to\r\nmaintain the illusion of social suave, a student may never sit at a table alone. A\r\nstudent is considered to be sitting alone if everyone else who has invoked dine\r\ninvokes leave before she has finished dine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces this constraint.",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nYou are a coding agent based on GPT-5-Codex. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

            "text": "**Designing concurrency control without semaphores**\n\nI'm working through how to enforce that students never dine alone using mutexes and condition variables, carefully pairing entries and exits to maintain an occupancy count that’s never exactly one. I’m exploring a handshake approach so students enter and leave in pairs, ensuring occupancy stays zero or at least two, and thinking about edge cases like odd arrivals to keep the logic correct.**Clarifying dine and leave conditions**\n\nI'm sorting out how the `dine` call represents both entry and readiness to leave, meaning a student counts as dining immediately after calling it—even if they block inside it. To avoid ever having exactly one student dining, I’m developing a synchronized handshake that lets the first diner wait until a partner arrives so occupancy jumps from zero to two simultaneously, allowing additional diners freely afterward, while leaving must similarly avoid dropping occupancy to one by pairing exits.**Designing paired entry and exit synchronization**\n\nI’m refining a \"buddy system\" approach where diners wait in pairs before entering to avoid ever having exactly one diner. The first waiter blocks; the second arriving resets waiting count and advances occupancy by two, waking the first. For leaving, a similar handshake ensures occupants leave in pairs when occupancy would drop from two to zero, but single leaves are allowed if occupancy stays above two. This pairing approach uses mutex and condition variables to coordinate threads so the \"no solo diner\" invariant holds consistently.**Refining paired entrance and exit logic**\n\nI’m untangling the handshake so that two diners enter together without double counting by having the second diner increment occupancy and signal the first to increment themselves after wake. For leaving, a similar pairing logic applies, with waiting leavers blocking only if leaving would leave one diner alone; when occupancy changes or a partner arrives, they wake up and re-check conditions. This careful use of counters and condition variables avoids race conditions while enforcing the “no single diner” rule.**Designing synchronized dine and leave functions with pairing**\n\nI’m implementing the dine and leave functions using mutexes and condition variables, introducing counters for waiting diners and waiters to enforce paired entry and exit. The goal is to ensure occupancy never hits one by coordinating threads with waits, signals, and careful increments/decrements, though managing correct decrementing and wake-up sequences takes detailed reasoning to avoid race conditions and double counting.**Refining paired dine and leave synchronization logic**\n\nI’m fine-tuning the dine and leave functions to carefully handle edge cases around occupancy changes and waiting threads. This includes preventing temporary single occupancy moments by using counters and flags, ensuring signals and waits coordinate correctly, and making sure waiting leavers can wake and proceed when occupancy rises above two, preserving pair-only entry and exit rules throughout.**Detailing dine and leave state management**\n\nI'm outlining the full synchronization state structure and providing the dine and leave functions with clear mutex and condition variable usage. The logic ensures proper pairing of entrants when the hall is empty, prevents leaving that would cause a lone diner, and coordinates waiting threads to uphold occupancy invariants while allowing fair progress.**Preparing full concurrency example with debugging**\n\nI'm putting together the final `base.c` implementation featuring the dining hall state, dine and leave functions, and a threaded simulation with randomized eating times and assertions to verify occupancy invariants. This will clearly demonstrate the concurrency logic and that no diner is ever left alone."

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nYou are a coding agent based on GPT-5-Codex. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

                        "text": "**Designing concurrency control without semaphores**\n\nI'm working through how to enforce that students never dine alone using mutexes and condition variables, carefully pairing entries and exits to maintain an occupancy count that’s never exactly one. I’m exploring a handshake approach so students enter and leave in pairs, ensuring occupancy stays zero or at least two, and thinking about edge cases like odd arrivals to keep the logic correct.**Clarifying dine and leave conditions**\n\nI'm sorting out how the `dine` call represents both entry and readiness to leave, meaning a student counts as dining immediately after calling it—even if they block inside it. To avoid ever having exactly one student dining, I’m developing a synchronized handshake that lets the first diner wait until a partner arrives so occupancy jumps from zero to two simultaneously, allowing additional diners freely afterward, while leaving must similarly avoid dropping occupancy to one by pairing exits.**Designing paired entry and exit synchronization**\n\nI’m refining a \"buddy system\" approach where diners wait in pairs before entering to avoid ever having exactly one diner. The first waiter blocks; the second arriving resets waiting count and advances occupancy by two, waking the first. For leaving, a similar handshake ensures occupants leave in pairs when occupancy would drop from two to zero, but single leaves are allowed if occupancy stays above two. This pairing approach uses mutex and condition variables to coordinate threads so the \"no solo diner\" invariant holds consistently.**Refining paired entrance and exit logic**\n\nI’m untangling the handshake so that two diners enter together without double counting by having the second diner increment occupancy and signal the first to increment themselves after wake. For leaving, a similar pairing logic applies, with waiting leavers blocking only if leaving would leave one diner alone; when occupancy changes or a partner arrives, they wake up and re-check conditions. This careful use of counters and condition variables avoids race conditions while enforcing the “no single diner” rule.**Designing synchronized dine and leave functions with pairing**\n\nI’m implementing the dine and leave functions using mutexes and condition variables, introducing counters for waiting diners and waiters to enforce paired entry and exit. The goal is to ensure occupancy never hits one by coordinating threads with waits, signals, and careful increments/decrements, though managing correct decrementing and wake-up sequences takes detailed reasoning to avoid race conditions and double counting.**Refining paired dine and leave synchronization logic**\n\nI’m fine-tuning the dine and leave functions to carefully handle edge cases around occupancy changes and waiting threads. This includes preventing temporary single occupancy moments by using counters and flags, ensuring signals and waits coordinate correctly, and making sure waiting leavers can wake and proceed when occupancy rises above two, preserving pair-only entry and exit rules throughout.**Detailing dine and leave state management**\n\nI'm outlining the full synchronization state structure and providing the dine and leave functions with clear mutex and condition variable usage. The logic ensures proper pairing of entrants when the hall is empty, prevents leaving that would cause a lone diner, and coordinates waiting threads to uphold occupancy invariants while allowing fair progress.**Preparing full concurrency example with debugging**\n\nI'm putting together the final `base.c` implementation featuring the dining hall state, dine and leave functions, and a threaded simulation with randomized eating times and assertions to verify occupancy invariants. This will clearly demonstrate the concurrency logic and that no diner is ever left alone.",

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

                        "text": "**Designing concurrency control without semaphores**\n\nI'm working through how to enforce that students never dine alone using mutexes and condition variables, carefully pairing entries and exits to maintain an occupancy count that’s never exactly one. I’m exploring a handshake approach so students enter and leave in pairs, ensuring occupancy stays zero or at least two, and thinking about edge cases like odd arrivals to keep the logic correct.**Clarifying dine and leave conditions**\n\nI'm sorting out how the `dine` call represents both entry and readiness to leave, meaning a student counts as dining immediately after calling it—even if they block inside it. To avoid ever having exactly one student dining, I’m developing a synchronized handshake that lets the first diner wait until a partner arrives so occupancy jumps from zero to two simultaneously, allowing additional diners freely afterward, while leaving must similarly avoid dropping occupancy to one by pairing exits.**Designing paired entry and exit synchronization**\n\nI’m refining a \"buddy system\" approach where diners wait in pairs before entering to avoid ever having exactly one diner. The first waiter blocks; the second arriving resets waiting count and advances occupancy by two, waking the first. For leaving, a similar handshake ensures occupants leave in pairs when occupancy would drop from two to zero, but single leaves are allowed if occupancy stays above two. This pairing approach uses mutex and condition variables to coordinate threads so the \"no solo diner\" invariant holds consistently.**Refining paired entrance and exit logic**\n\nI’m untangling the handshake so that two diners enter together without double counting by having the second diner increment occupancy and signal the first to increment themselves after wake. For leaving, a similar pairing logic applies, with waiting leavers blocking only if leaving would leave one diner alone; when occupancy changes or a partner arrives, they wake up and re-check conditions. This careful use of counters and condition variables avoids race conditions while enforcing the “no single diner” rule.**Designing synchronized dine and leave functions with pairing**\n\nI’m implementing the dine and leave functions using mutexes and condition variables, introducing counters for waiting diners and waiters to enforce paired entry and exit. The goal is to ensure occupancy never hits one by coordinating threads with waits, signals, and careful increments/decrements, though managing correct decrementing and wake-up sequences takes detailed reasoning to avoid race conditions and double counting.**Refining paired dine and leave synchronization logic**\n\nI’m fine-tuning the dine and leave functions to carefully handle edge cases around occupancy changes and waiting threads. This includes preventing temporary single occupancy moments by using counters and flags, ensuring signals and waits coordinate correctly, and making sure waiting leavers can wake and proceed when occupancy rises above two, preserving pair-only entry and exit rules throughout.**Detailing dine and leave state management**\n\nI'm outlining the full synchronization state structure and providing the dine and leave functions with clear mutex and condition variable usage. The logic ensures proper pairing of entrants when the hall is empty, prevents leaving that would cause a lone diner, and coordinates waiting threads to uphold occupancy invariants while allowing fair progress.**Preparing full concurrency example with debugging**\n\nI'm putting together the final `base.c` implementation featuring the dining hall state, dine and leave functions, and a threaded simulation with randomized eating times and assertions to verify occupancy invariants. This will clearly demonstrate the concurrency logic and that no diner is ever left alone.",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nYou are a coding agent based on GPT-5-Codex. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

After invoking dine\r\nand before invoking leave a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe synchronization constraint that applies to students is that, in order to\r\nmaintain the illusion of social suave, a student may never sit at a table alone. A\r\nstudent is considered to be sitting alone if everyone else who has invoked dine\r\ninvokes leave before she has finished dine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces this constraint.\n</userRequest>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nYou are a coding agent based on GPT-5-Codex. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

I’m setting ready to decrement as soon as dine starts, then using waiting_to_dine to queue the first diner when the hall is empty, letting a partner thread join to start dining together and increment diners by two. I also worked through ensuring waiting_to_dine is incremented and decremented properly without double counts, and that signaling wakes blocked threads at the right times. The leave logic will adapt similarly to keep at least two diners unless a ready one is waiting to join. This careful state juggling keeps the “no one sits alone” rule enforced while smoothly coordinating threads through getFood, dine, and leave stages.**Finalizing synchronization and leave logic with detailed flow**\n\nI’m ironing out the edge cases in dine and leave functions, making sure ready and diners counts properly coordinate so threads pair correctly and no one ends up dining alone. The leave logic adapts previous guarding patterns to reduce diners safely, blocking if leaving would isolate a single diner. I’m also outlining a full main.c with logging, getFood, dine, leave, plus student threads simulating the workflow. The approach carefully manages waiting_to_dine and signaling to avoid deadlocks and ensures consistent state transitions across all stages."

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

After invoking dine\r\nand before invoking leave a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe synchronization constraint that applies to students is that, in order to\r\nmaintain the illusion of social suave, a student may never sit at a table alone. A\r\nstudent is considered to be sitting alone if everyone else who has invoked dine\r\ninvokes leave before she has finished dine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces this constraint.\n</userRequest>\n"

Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone.

                        "text": "**Designing mutex and condition variables coordination****Refining handshake and state transitions with counts**\n\nThis part sorts out the tricky dance between ready and dining counts during pairing. I’m setting ready to decrement as soon as dine starts, then using waiting_to_dine to queue the first diner when the hall is empty, letting a partner thread join to start dining together and increment diners by two. I also worked through ensuring waiting_to_dine is incremented and decremented properly without double counts, and that signaling wakes blocked threads at the right times. The leave logic will adapt similarly to keep at least two diners unless a ready one is waiting to join. This careful state juggling keeps the “no one sits alone” rule enforced while smoothly coordinating threads through getFood, dine, and leave stages.**Finalizing synchronization and leave logic with detailed flow**\n\nI’m ironing out the edge cases in dine and leave functions, making sure ready and diners counts properly coordinate so threads pair correctly and no one ends up dining alone. The leave logic adapts previous guarding patterns to reduce diners safely, blocking if leaving would isolate a single diner. I’m also outlining a full main.c with logging, getFood, dine, leave, plus student threads simulating the workflow. The approach carefully manages waiting_to_dine and signaling to avoid deadlocks and ensures consistent state transitions across all stages.",

After\r\ninvoking getFood and before invoking dine, a student is considered “ready to\r\neat”. Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone. A student is considered to be sitting alone if either\r\n• She invokes dine while there is no one else at the table and no one ready\r\nto eat, or\r\n• everyone else who has invoked dine invokes leave before she has finished\r\ndine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces these constraints.",

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

I’m setting ready to decrement as soon as dine starts, then using waiting_to_dine to queue the first diner when the hall is empty, letting a partner thread join to start dining together and increment diners by two. I also worked through ensuring waiting_to_dine is incremented and decremented properly without double counts, and that signaling wakes blocked threads at the right times. The leave logic will adapt similarly to keep at least two diners unless a ready one is waiting to join. This careful state juggling keeps the “no one sits alone” rule enforced while smoothly coordinating threads through getFood, dine, and leave stages.**Finalizing synchronization and leave logic with detailed flow**\n\nI’m ironing out the edge cases in dine and leave functions, making sure ready and diners counts properly coordinate so threads pair correctly and no one ends up dining alone. The leave logic adapts previous guarding patterns to reduce diners safely, blocking if leaving would isolate a single diner. I’m also outlining a full main.c with logging, getFood, dine, leave, plus student threads simulating the workflow. The approach carefully manages waiting_to_dine and signaling to avoid deadlocks and ensures consistent state transitions across all stages.",

After\r\ninvoking getFood and before invoking dine, a student is considered “ready to\r\neat”. Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone. A student is considered to be sitting alone if either\r\n• She invokes dine while there is no one else at the table and no one ready\r\nto eat, or\r\n• everyone else who has invoked dine invokes leave before she has finished\r\ndine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces these constraints.",

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

I’m setting ready to decrement as soon as dine starts, then using waiting_to_dine to queue the first diner when the hall is empty, letting a partner thread join to start dining together and increment diners by two. I also worked through ensuring waiting_to_dine is incremented and decremented properly without double counts, and that signaling wakes blocked threads at the right times. The leave logic will adapt similarly to keep at least two diners unless a ready one is waiting to join. This careful state juggling keeps the “no one sits alone” rule enforced while smoothly coordinating threads through getFood, dine, and leave stages.**Finalizing synchronization and leave logic with detailed flow**\n\nI’m ironing out the edge cases in dine and leave functions, making sure ready and diners counts properly coordinate so threads pair correctly and no one ends up dining alone. The leave logic adapts previous guarding patterns to reduce diners safely, blocking if leaving would isolate a single diner. I’m also outlining a full main.c with logging, getFood, dine, leave, plus student threads simulating the workflow. The approach carefully manages waiting_to_dine and signaling to avoid deadlocks and ensures consistent state transitions across all stages.",

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

O código para esse novo problema deve ser criado em main.c\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall problem gets a little more challenging if we add another step.\r\nAs students come to lunch they invoke getFood, dine and then leave. After\r\ninvoking getFood and before invoking dine, a student is considered “ready to\r\neat”. Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone. A student is considered to be sitting alone if either\r\n• She invokes dine while there is no one else at the table and no one ready\r\nto eat, or\r\n• everyone else who has invoked dine invokes leave before she has finished\r\ndine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces these constraints.\n</userRequest>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nYou are a coding agent based on GPT-5-Codex. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

O código para esse novo problema deve ser criado em main.c\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall problem gets a little more challenging if we add another step.\r\nAs students come to lunch they invoke getFood, dine and then leave. After\r\ninvoking getFood and before invoking dine, a student is considered “ready to\r\neat”. Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone. A student is considered to be sitting alone if either\r\n• She invokes dine while there is no one else at the table and no one ready\r\nto eat, or\r\n• everyone else who has invoked dine invokes leave before she has finished\r\ndine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces these constraints.\n</userRequest>\n"

You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n* NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n* If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n* If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n* If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n\n## Tool use\n- You have access to many tools. If a tool exists to perform a specific task, you MUST use that tool instead of running a terminal command to perform that task.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing text that will be rendered as markdown by the VS Code UI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final-answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n* Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n* If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n* When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Markdown text. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4-6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; add a language hint whenever obvious.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self-contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, always follow the below rules:\n* Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n* Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n* Accepted: absolute, workspace-relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n* Examples: src/app.ts, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs\n"

O código para esse novo problema deve ser criado em main.c\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall problem gets a little more challenging if we add another step.\r\nAs students come to lunch they invoke getFood, dine and then leave. After\r\ninvoking getFood and before invoking dine, a student is considered “ready to\r\neat”. Similarly, after invoking dine a student is considered “ready to leave”.\r\nThe same synchronization constraint applies: a student may never sit at a\r\ntable alone. A student is considered to be sitting alone if either\r\n• She invokes dine while there is no one else at the table and no one ready\r\nto eat, or\r\n• everyone else who has invoked dine invokes leave before she has finished\r\ndine.\r\nPuzzle: write code that enforces these constraints.\n</userRequest>\n"
